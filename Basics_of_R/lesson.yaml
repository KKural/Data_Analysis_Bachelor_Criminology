    In this lesson, you will work with a pre-loaded synthetic dataset, crime_stats_ghent.
    This simulated data mimics real criminology statistics so you can safely explore
    and practise basic R inspection functions.
    Youâ€™ll learn to load packages, view the first rows, inspect structure,
    check class, dimensions, length, glimpse, and summary.
