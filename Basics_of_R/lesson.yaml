- Class: mult_question
  Output: Q8 The variable clearance_rate in police_effort_index is measured on which scale?
  AnswerChoices: Nominal;Ordinal;Ratio
  CorrectAnswer: Ratio
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = "Ratio")
  Hint: |
    Can you subtract and say one value is twice another?
  Feedback: |
    ✔️ Correct! clearance_rate is a ratio variable because it has a true zero and meaningful ratios.
    ❌ Remember, ratio variables have a true zero and allow for meaningful comparisons.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Q9 Extract the district column from crime_stats_ghent.
  CorrectAnswer: crime_stats_ghent$district
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "crime_stats_ghent$district")
  Hint: |
    Use $ to extract a column.
  Feedback: |
    ✔️ Well done!
    ❌ Use crime_stats_ghent$district.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Q10 Create low_safety as all rows in fear_of_crime_survey where feel_safe_night < 3. Print the first 6 rows.
  CorrectAnswer: low_safety <- fear_of_crime_survey %>% filter(feel_safe_night < 3); head(low_safety)
  AnswerTests: is.data.frame(last_value) && nrow(last_value) > 0
  Hint: |
    Use %>% filter(feel_safe_night < 3) and assign to low_safety, then print the first 6 rows.
  Feedback: |
    ✔️ Nice!
    ❌ Did you filter and assign correctly, and print the first 6 rows?
